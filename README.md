## WHMCS IDE Helper

This is just a small helper for anybody struggling, with WHMCS development.
It contains the definitions for majority of the WHMCS core classes, therefore making a WHMCS development a bit less painful experience :)

### Manual Installation

Just copy the `whmcs_ide.php` file somewhere into your project, should work fine with most of them like PHPStorm, VSCode, Atom, NetBeans etc.

### Composer Installation
Alternatively you can use composer:

```
composer require indicio-software/whmcs-ide-helper
```

As long as your `vendor` directory is not excluded from indexing, you should see all the definitions in place :)
